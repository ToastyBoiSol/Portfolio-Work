                <p class="BgBdy">Heyo! My name is Nick Matteson (he/him), I’m 19, and I love making things!<br><br> I’ve always been really interested in art and design. I mostly do illustration, but i enjoy layout and web design just as much! The main things I like to focus on are color palettes, accessability, and Consistency.<br> I’m always willing to revise and take critisism. I know I’m still learning- I just got into this, after all! I’m eager and ready to learn new things and have new experiences.</p>

            <section>
                <p class="BgBdy">It all started way back, February 2021. I had just graduated from High School the year before, and I was starting to get a bit restless. So were my parents.<br> My mom found a really cool program- er- “Bootcamp”, run out of The university of oregon. User interface and user experience design. So I decided to enroll.<br> Over the course of the class, we learned how to make a fully-functional website ourselves! The design part was pretty simple- it took some time to get used to all the new programs and their tools, but other than that, we made wireframes and conducted user research.<br> Then the hard part came- Coding. It was actually a lot of fun to learn the basics. It was just... chaotic. It got really overwhelming- very much so, considering the pace of the class. However, by the end, i managed to get everything done!</p>
